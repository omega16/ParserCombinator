# ParserCombinator

A simple implementation of the old parsec library of Haskell in python3.8+

This is a personal project and no production code.

The target of the project is to understand better how monads work and to 
have a hand-writed parsed for [LispMal](https://github.com/omega16/mal).

Implementation is based on [this](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf).
